        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is{' '}
        <strong className="">Jaden Wong</strong>. I am a{' '}
        <strong className="">software engineer </strong> based in NYC with a
        passion in full stack development and software engineering.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I recently graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor&apos;s
        in Computer Science and am currently looking a full-time software
        developer position.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My technical expertise spans across full-stack development with a focus
        on both frontend and backend technologies. I am proficient in
        JavaScript, Python, Java and several other languages, as well as
        frameworks like Next.js and React.js.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have interned at prominent organizations like Spotify and NYC
        Department for the Aging, where I honed my skills in data analysis,
        network operations, and software development. Most recently, I served as
        a Software Engineer Intern at Develop For Good, contributing to the
        development of a litigation tracking system for Human Rights First, a
        not-for-profit organization.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a
        developer, with a strong commitment to delivering impactful,
        user-friendly solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of tech, you&apos;ll typically find me getting some gains at the
        gym, playing videogames and brewing a scrumptious latte.
